## Overview
This project aims to employ Java to provide an interactive space exploration experience in which users can navigate through several pages to learn more about the solar system.

This project intended to use object-oriented programming (OOP) for a university course project.  


## Instructions
Install the repository to the local machine and execute the files in the `src` directory to start using this project. 
The application allows the user to select which section they are interested in discovering from three selections (Planets, Constellations, and Observatories). Each one will provide interesting aspects to learn about.


## Screenshots
#### âœ§ Main page 
Our bikeshare data analysis program provides an interactive user experience that allows users to see their needs, making it easy to quickly find answers to specific questions.

The first four images show different parts of the user interface, where users can choose the city, month, day of the week, or combination of these options to analyze.

#### âœ§ Sections
Once the user enters the desired options, the program calculates statistics and provides insightful analysis based on the user's choices. 

The next two images show different parts of the analysis results. The program presents the data in a clear and easy-to-understand format, making it simple to draw meaningful conclusions.

#### âœ§ 1. Planets
The last image shows how the program asks the user if they want to see a part of the dataset. This feature allows users to explore the data and see the details behind the analysis, making it easy to verify the accuracy of the results.
