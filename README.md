## Overview
This project uses Java to provide an immersive space exploration experience where users can navigate through various pages to discover more about the solar system. The goal of this project is to employ object-oriented programming (OOP) for a university course project.  


## Instructions
To start using this project, install the repository on your local machine and execute the files in the `src` directory.  


## Screenshots

#### âœ§ 1. Planets
The first section focuses on the planets in our solar system.  
Users can input their age and weight to see how it would differ on each planet.

#### âœ§ 2. Constellation 
The second section is dedicated to learning about constellations.  
Users can choose from three constellations (Big Dipper, Draco, and Cepheus) and play a simple dot-connected game.   
The dots represent stars, and when connected, they form a constellation.  
After connecting the dots, users can press "check" to see if they correctly formed the constellation and to learn some fascinating facts about it.
