#### âœ§ 1. Planets
The first section focuses on the planets in our solar system.  
Users can input their age and weight to see how it would differ on each planet.

#### âœ§ 2. Constellation 
The second section is dedicated to learning about constellations.  
Users can choose from three constellations (Big Dipper, Draco, and Cepheus) and play a simple dot-connected game.   
The dots represent stars, and when connected, they form a constellation.  
After connecting the dots, users can press "check" to see if they correctly formed the constellation and to learn some fascinating facts about it.
