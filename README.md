## Overview
This project aims to employ Java to provide an interactive space exploration experience in which users can navigate through several pages to learn more about the solar system.

This project intended to use object-oriented programming (OOP) for a university course project.  


## Instructions
Install the repository to the local machine and execute the files in the `src` directory to start using this project. 
The application allows the user to select which section they are interested in discovering from three selections (Planets, Constellations, and Observatories). Each one will provide interesting aspects to learn about.


## Screenshots

##### âœ§ 2. Constellation 
The second section is all about the constellation, I provided three constellation to discover (Big Dipper - Draco - Cepheus)
users will choose one of them and play a simple dot connected game, as the dots represent stars and when they are connected together 
they form a constellation, after connecting the dots users will press check to see if they form the constellation right
and to see some facts about it.
